## Session Registration Portal
This is a minimal SPA (svelte.js) with a form component which takes in user credentials :- (name, email, mobile, preffered date & time, and reason of appointment) and displays field to vaildate OTP to user's mobile (made use of Twilio API). The entire project is backend specific (i made it to learn the backend stuff better, available at [backend](https://github.com/vercetti322/appointment-backend.git)).
